## Objectives
- Meet customer demand for three flagship products: **Rigel Gold (face cream)**, **Apollo Blue (body cream)**, and **Eris Satin (hand cream)**.
- Address internal labor and material constraints.
- Determine optimal outsourcing strategy without exposing proprietary formulas.

## Methods & Tools
- **Excel Solver:** Linear Programming (LP) optimization.
- **Scenario Modeling:** Tested alternative capacity and cost scenarios.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Evaluated labor and material constraint impacts.
